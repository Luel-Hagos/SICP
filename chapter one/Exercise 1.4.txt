Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows
for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. 
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

Solution
-----------------
it finds the summation of some number a with absolute value of b.
i.e. if b>0 it will evaluate a + b
else it will evaluate a - b.
